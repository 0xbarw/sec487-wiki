---

The goal of the SEC487 wiki is to increase the **in-class**, and, most importantly, **after-class** value of the course material. This wiki is, and likely always will be, very much a work in progress.

Contained in the wiki, you will find:

* (For SEC487 students) Electronic Copies of the Lab Guides (**copy and paste, FTW!!!**)
* Tool and technique cheat sheets
* Instructor information
* Methods of suggesting content and noting bugs... and more

Not in the Class Yet?
-----------

Hey this wiki is for everyone to use. If you are in the SEC487 course, you get the additional lab and video files for hands-on practice.

Interested in increasing your OSINT knowledge? Consider signing up for this [SEC487: Open-Source Intelligence Gathering and Analysis](https://www.sans.org/course/open-source-intelligence-gathering) course.

Course/Lab/Wiki Bugs or Suggestions
----------

Please let us know if you find any bugs in the courseware/labs/wiki we need to squash. Also, reach out if you have suggestions to improve the course (e.g. content/labs/tools that should be added, removed, or updated). The easiest ways to submit these improvements are:

1. Using the `#coursewaresuggestions` channel in the course <https://sec487alum.slack.com> Slack (See the Day 1 lab to get yourself set up) or go to <https://sec487.info/joinslack> and create an account).
1. Or by sending an email to **<updates@sec487.info>**

SEC487 Students, Keep In Touch
----------

We recognize that the learning doesn't stop once you complete the course. In fact, it usually just begins. Stay in touch with your instructors and fellow students by joining the SEC487 alumni Slack group. Directions to request access are explained in the SEC487 Day 1 courseware.

Social Media
----------

Do you have a social media account? Of COURSE you do. Feel free to use the `#SEC487` hash tag on those sites to discuss neat things you learned in class.
