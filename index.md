### **`SEC487 Portal Version: 0.0.1 #Beta`**
### **`Course Version A01_01`**

---

The goal of the SEC487 wiki is to increase the **in-class**, and, most importantly, **after-class** value of the course material. This wiki is, and likely always will be, very much a work in progress.

Contained in the wiki, you will find:
- Electronic Copies of the Lab Guides (**copy and paste, FTW!!!**)
- Tool and technique cheat sheets
...and more

Course/Lab/Wiki Bugs or Suggestions
----------

---

Please let us know if you find any bugs in the courseware/labs/wiki we need to squash. Also, reach out if you have suggestions to improve the course (e.g. content/labs/tools that should be added, removed, or updated). The easiest ways to submit these improvements are:

1. Using the #coursewaresuggestions channel in the course sec487alum.slack.com Slack (See the Day 1 lab to get yourself set up!)
2. Or by sending an email to **<bugs@sec487.info>**
