`SEC487 Portal Version: 0.0.2 - Course Version D01_01`

---

The goal of the SEC487 wiki is to increase the **in-class**, and, most importantly, **after-class** value of the course material. This wiki is, and likely always will be, very much a work in progress.

Contained in the wiki, you will find:
- (For SEC487 students) Electronic Copies of the Lab Guides (**copy and paste, FTW!!!**)
- Tool and technique cheat sheets
- Instructor information
- Methods of suggestion content and noting bugs
...and more

Not in the Class Yet?

Hey this wiki is for everyone to use. If you are in the SEC487 course, you get the additional lab and video files for hands-on practice.
